Q:Hi, my knowledge of Z80 and CPC firmware is quite limited but I know here there are experienced people.
I have been thinking about a KVM switch for the CPC so you can send keystrokes and receive screen. i would use a microcontroller connected to the expansion port.
For the screen I think it could be done by intercepting the writings to video memory from  C000 to FFFF.
For the keys, I am not totally sure how to "emulate" a key press, it looks like AY-3-8912 and 8255 are involved in the process.

A:Specifically for the CPC you can POKE in certain addresses and it will emulate key presses.
I haven't tried this while playing a game though, just in BASIC
Also, C000-FFFF is not always the video memory address, just the default

Hm... I've used &B63E in the past, but I'm not sure why or how
Here's my assembly code from back in the day:

KEYPRES:      EQU  0xB63E

RKEY:         RET  Z              ;Any num of par
              PUSH AF
              LD   A,(IX+0)
              INC  IX
              INC  IX
              CALL RKEY_M
              POP  AF
              DEC  A
              JR   RKEY
RKEY_M:       LD   HL,KEYPRES
RKEY_1:       SUB  8
              INC  HL
              JR   NC,RKEY_1
              ADD  A,8
              LD   B,A
              LD   A,1
RKEY_R:       RLCA
              DJNZ RKEY_R
              CPL
              AND  (HL)
              LD   (HL),A
              RET

This is part of an RSX command  |RKEY which took n key parameters (1-32 IIRC), each of which was a keypress
I'm guessing using the actual firmware command is probably better.
Apparently &BB0C only works for the equivalent of INKEY$. It doesn't work for e.g. cursor keys (or joysticks) etc.
My code presses all 1-32 keys at the same time.
And it's keys, not characters.
